This GitHub repository showcases the machine learning projects I implemented in the process of obtaining Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree at Udacity. The following bullet points summarize the key takeaways I learnt from the program.  

You can view the Jupyter Notebook implementations and the accompanying output files in respective folders for each of the projects.

* Developed machine learning models using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras, applying techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering to solve real-world problems.
* Built end-to-end machine learning workflows in Jupyter notebooks, covering exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and performance optimization.
* Worked with real-world datasets, performing feature selection, and model evaluation using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
* Applied supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including decision trees, SVMs, k-nearest neighbors, and k-means clustering among others, to address complex data challenges.
* Implemented deep learning models, such as neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for analyzing unstructured data like images.
